Creating a Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a great project
to practice web development skills. HTML is used to structure the game grid with
a 3x3 layout, where each cell is clickable for players to mark their moves. CSS
is employed to style the grid, making it visually appealing, with distinct
colors and animations for player turns and win conditions. JavaScript handles
the game logic, including detecting player moves, checking for a winner, and
alternating turns between players. By working on this project, you can reinforce
concepts like event handling, DOM manipulation, and conditional logic while
building an interactive game.
